                  <h3>My Journey</h3>
                  <p>My path to becoming a web developer has certainly been an atypical one. Although I've always had a desire and the curiosity to explore learning how to code, I went years without mustering up the courage to do so because I was initially too intimidated by it. This all changed about a year ago, when I finally decided to delve into some online courses to get my feet wet. After writing my first "Hello World" application, and experiencing the quintessential programming "a-ha" moment as most others do, I knew immediately that I wanted to keep pushing and learning more.</p>
                  <h3>Reaching the Crossroads</h3>
                  <p>After some more time working at my corporate job in finance, I came to grips with the reality that I wasn't truly being fulfilled by the work that I was doing. With each passing day, as I continued to teach myself new programming fundamentals after work and on the weekends during my spare time, the idea of pursuing a career in web development loomed large. I still was coming to grips with my irrational fear of whether or not I could actually be successful, but at that stage it was too early to tell. After all, as the old adage says: Nothing in life comes easy, and you certainly won't know unless you try.
                  <h3>My Leap of Faith</h3>
                  <p>So, try is what I decided to do- I started researching coding bootcamps as an alternative to catapulting my knowledge forward and landed on Thinkful's Full Stack Software Engineering program. I decided to quit my stable full-time job at a very unprecented time during the heat of the new Coronavirus pandemic and began learning remotely full-time at the end of April 2020. As-of February 2021, I am almost finished with the curriculum and also plan to begin my career search very soon. I cannot wait to see where this new journey will take me!</p>
